#data-structures
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

This repo contains implementations to the following data structures:
-stack 
-queue
-linked list
-binary search tree
-graph (adjacency list)
-hash table
-set
-tree
-bloom filter
-red black tree

All of the data structures were completed as a pair during the sprint except for the red-black tree, which was only just started. I completed the red-black tree on my own after the sprint was over.
