#data-structures
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.

This repo contains implementations to the following data structures:
-stack<br/>
-queue<br/>
-linked list<br/>
-binary search tree<br/>
-graph (adjacency list)<br/>
-hash table<br/>
-set<br/>
-tree<br/>
-bloom filter<br/>
-red black tree<br/>

All of the data structures were completed as a pair during the sprint except for the red-black tree, which was only just started. I completed the red-black tree on my own after the sprint was over.
